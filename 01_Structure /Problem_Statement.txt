Write functions to compute sum, difference, product & division of two complex variables of the below structure.

typedef struct complex_t {

float real;

float imaginary;

} complex_t;

Guidelines:

    Do not use scanf functions. Assume test values for arguments to functions.
    Implement different functions for each operation instead of writing everything under main function.
    Create a header file and source code file.
